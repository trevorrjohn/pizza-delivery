Pizza Delivery
Part 1

Maria is delivering pizzas to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses. She begins by delivering a pizza to the house at her starting location; a dispatcher then calls via radio and tells her where to move next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), east (>), or west (<). After each move, Maria delivers a pizza to the house at her new location. The dispatcher has been a little spacey lately, so Maria sometimes ends up delivering more than one pizza to the same house.

Here are some examples:

    > delivers pizzas to two houses: one to the house at the starting location, and one to the house directly east of the starting location.

    ^>v< delivers pizzas to four houses in a square; the house at the starting/ending location ends up with two pizzas.

    ^v^v^v^v^v delivers a bunch of pizzas to some very lucky people at only two houses.

Given the string of dispatcher inputs in this file, how many houses receive at least one pizza?
Part 2

The next day, to speed up the process, Maria rents a pizza-delivering goat named Clovis. Maria and Clovis begin at the same starting location, and they both deliver a pizza to this starting house. Maria and Clovis then take turns moving based on the dispatcher’s instructions.

Here are some examples:

    ^v now delivers pizzas to three houses; Maria goes north and Clovis goes south.

    ^>v< now delivers pizzas to three houses; Maria and Clovis both end up back where they started.

    ^v^v^v^v^v now delivers pizzas to 11 houses; Maria treks north and Clovis treks south.

Given the same string of dispatcher inputs as in Part One, how many houses receive at least one pizza?
Guidelines for your solution

Please provide a solution that answers Part 1 and Part 2 in Javascript or Ruby.

By design, this is a fairly simple exercise, so we’re hoping for solutions that reflect what you consider well-factored production-quality code. The best solutions will be elegant, as well as correct. Feel free to pull in any libraries you like.

When you’re done, submit your solution either as a private repo shared with the github handle mistidoi, or send it along as a zip file.
